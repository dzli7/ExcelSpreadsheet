IMPROVEMENT 1:

Theory: 
Our recursive calls to set_cell_contents was too slow.

Rationale: 
This was especially evident when we ran our stress tests and they reached 
max recursion depth. Also, running our profiler revealed that nearly all the 
time of computation was being spent in set_cell_contents.

Outcome:
In order to fix this problem, we changed set_cell_contents to be iterative.
Instead of recursively calling set_cell_contents on every cell that would be
affected by the updating of its parents, we simply parse the formula and update
it without calling set_cell_contents. This way, we can prevent the recursion
depth being reached and greatly decrease the computation time. Now, we can
successfully run our stress tests.


IMPROVEMENT 2:

Theory:
Our formula parser was no interpreting literal errors (ex: #REF!) as the error
value but as something else.

Rationale:
We failed a lot of acceptance tests regarding the computation of literal errors.

Outcome: 
We were able to fix this problem by adding a error check in our parser. This way,
when it found a literal error reference, it would return the value of the
corresponding CellErrorType.
